## GCP Kubernetes
### Kubernetes:
1. It is a container orchestrator engine (COE)
2. It has 2 primary feature: Cluster & Schedule
3. **COES** stads for container orchestrator engine space.
4. Features: 
    1. Horizontal Scalling
    2. Load Balancing
    3. Fault Tolerance
5. Negative Aspect:
    1. Its little complex
    2. Its require Kubectl cli instead of docker. Also there is yaml file. So we need to learn new things.
7. Docker:
    1. Its a runtime engine
    

#### Other COE is Swarm & Messo(Marathon)
    1. Swarm is easy to learn if you know docker
